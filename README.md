# Self Organizing Maps

This project uses a machine learning methodology to explore spatial data and test the efficacy of the Scottish Index of Multi Deprivartion (SIMD) (Scottish Government, 2016).

## Background

The Self Organizing maps (SOM) is an algorithm belonging to the broad family of the Artificial Neural Networks. Given a dataset
with multiple variables and observations it performs both (1) clustering and (2) dimensional reduction (Skupin and Agarwal, 2008).  
Clustering means that the SOM algorithm evaluates the similarities and the differences between the observations, grouping together the ones that are more similar.  
The dimensional reduction takes place when the SOM represents high dimensional data (many variables) in a 2-dimensional space, consisting of a grid of cells. These characteristics make the SOM a very good tool for initial data-mining exploration (Vesanto and Alhoniemi, 2000).
